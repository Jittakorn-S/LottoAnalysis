## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Country Support**: Scrapes and analyzes data for both **Thai (Sanook)** and **Laos (Expserve)** lotteries.
* **Multi-Model Analysis**: Choose from several AI and statistical models for prediction:
    * **Comprehensive Statistics**: A robust model based on frequency analysis to find the mode (most common number).
    * **Numerology**: Analyzes patterns using the ancient practice of digital roots.
    * **Machine Learning**: A Decision Tree model that learns from past results to predict the last digit of the next number.
    * **Markov Chains**: A probabilistic model that analyzes the transitional probability between lottery numbers.
* **Automated Data Scraping**: Fetches up-to-date lottery results directly from the web in the background.
* **Modern Web Interface**: A clean and responsive UI built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, allowing for dynamic content updates.
* **High-Performance Backend**: Built with Rust and the Actix Web framework for a fast, reliable, and concurrent experience. It also uses `mimalloc` for optimized memory allocation.
* **Containerized & Deployable**: Fully containerized with Docker for easy, consistent deployment anywhere. Includes a `render.yaml` for one-click deployment on [Render](https://render.com/).
